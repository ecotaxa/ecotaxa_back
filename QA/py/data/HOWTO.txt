 - Start from one or several directories like m106_mn01_n1_sml, m106_mn02_n2_sml
 - Zip all into a zip file which can be imported into EcoTaxa

To build an UVPV6 import file:
 - Start from one or several diectories like b_da_19_Images
 - Zip the content of each of them into zip file named e.g. b_da_19_Images.zip. The zip file must NOT contain a root directory, only files flat.
 - Zip all obtained zip files into a final e.g. V6.zip which can be imported into EcoTaxa
