- Dataset title

Choose a title that is descriptive, meaningful and concise. A good title allows a user to a first assessment whether the dataset is useful for the intended purpose. EMODnet Biology recommends including the region and time period of sampling. For example: "Benthic data from the Southern Irish Sea from 1989-1991"/"Zoobenthos of the Kyklades (Aegean Sea) from a survey in 2009".

If a dataset has already been published with a title that does not conform these above requirements, the original title should be kept, as re-publishing the dataset with a completely new title is likely to cause confusion and maybe data duplication.
- Abstract

Provide a good abstract that can help potential users understand if the data are of interest to them. This should be a short description providing an indication of the content of the dataset (e.g. Distribution of dinoflagellates causing harmful algal bloom in the Mediterranean sea collected from literature. The data contains only HABs that appeared prior to 2004.).

The extensive description, if included should be written in plain language and include the answers to the following questions: WHAT, WHERE, WHEN, HOW, WHY and WHO.
- Dataset contact

The resource contact, person or organisation that can be contacted in case a user has questions related to the dataset or seeks collaboration: name and institute of the data provider, an email address.
- Data creator(s)

They are either the persons or institutes responsible for the creation/maintenance of the dataset.The data creators will be mentioned in the citation.
- Person providing the metadata

The person who created the content of the metadata record. This is usually the person who gave a title the dataset and wrote the abstract.
- Keywords

Add a few keywords that enhance dataset discovery, they can originate from the ASFA list or can be created by you.
- Data licence

Specify the usage of the dataset or a data licence: i.e.: under which conditions the dataset can be used. EMODnet Biology requests the use of Creative Commons licences:

- Temporal scope

Give the date or the temporal scope covered by your dataset. If there is a large temporal gap (+2 years) this should be indicated. 
- Geographical scope

Describe the spatial or geographical extent of the data by listing the area(s) or location(s) where data was collected (e.g. South Atlantic Ocean, Belgian part of the North Sea). We encourage the use of Marine Regions to find adequate geo-units.
- Taxonomic scope

Provide an overview of the taxonomic scope present in the dataset (e.g Crustacea, Pisces). Make sure to pick the appropriate taxonomic level. We recommend the use of the World Register of Marine Species to find the adequate taxa.
- Themes

Specific for EMODnet Biology, it should describe the themes covered by the dataset: Algae, Angiosperms, Benthos, Birds, Fish, Mammals, Phytoplankton, Reptiles, Zooplankton.
- Publications related to the dataset

Here you can list all publications which are (partly) based on data from this dataset, that describe it (e.g. a data-paper) or that were used to compile the data from it (if the dataset is based on literature studies).
