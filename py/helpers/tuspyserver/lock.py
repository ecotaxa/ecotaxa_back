File locking utilities for tus uploads.

Provides advisory file locking using fcntl (Unix) to prevent race conditions
during concurrent upload operations. This implementation matches tusd's approach
by using separate lock files stored in a .locks directory, where each lock file
contains the PID of the process holding the lock.
